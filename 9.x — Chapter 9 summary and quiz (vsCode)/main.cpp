    Question #1

    In designing a game, we decide we want to have monsters, because everyone likes fighting monsters. 
    Declare a struct that represents your monster. The monster should have a type that can be one of 
    the following: an ogre, a dragon, an orc, a giant spider, or a slime. Use an enum class for this.

    Each individual monster should also have a name (use a std::string), as well as an amount of 
    health that represents how much damage they can take before they die. Write a function named 
    printMonster() that prints out all of the structâ€™s members. Instantiate an ogre and a slime, 
    initialize them using an initializer list, and pass them to printMonster().

    Your program should produce the following output:

    This Ogre is named Torg and has 145 health.
    This Slime is named Blurp and has 23 health.
    */

    Monsters ogre{"jajko", 123};
    Monsters slime{"slimak", 234};

    printMonster(Monsters_type::an_ogre, ogre);
    printMonster(Monsters_type::a_slime, slime);
